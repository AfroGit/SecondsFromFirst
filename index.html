  <h1>Class Basic Syntax</h1>
  <p>
    We often need to create many objects of the same kind.
    In modern JavaScript, there’s a more advanced “class” construct, 
    that introduces great new features which are useful for object-oriented     
    programming.
  </p>
  <h2>But how...</h2>
  <p>
    In this case I use new ExpressoMachine() to create a new object with all the 
    listed methods.
    The <span>constructor()</span> method is called automatically by     
    <span>new</span>, so we can initialize the object there.<br><br>
    When new ExpressoMachine("digital") is called:
    A new object is created.
    The constructor runs with the given argument and assigns it to <span>this.name</span>.
